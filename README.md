## 💡 Usage Guidelines

### Framework Selection Decision Tree

```
Is this a crisis/tight deadline?
├─ YES → Axiom Ultimate
└─ NO → Is this complex technical work?
    ├─ YES → Working in IDE?
    │   ├─ YES → Codium
    │   └─ NO → Need strategic ownership?
    │       ├─ YES → Axiom v9.0
    │       └─ NO → Axiom v8.0
    └─ NO → Quick help needed?
        └─ YES → Optimized Technical
```

### Best Practices

1. **🎯 Match Context to Framework** - Don't use a sledgehammer for a thumbtack
2. **⚡ Trust the Process** - Let the framework guide the interaction style
3. **🔄 Iterate Rapidly** - Use the TODO systems for continuous progress tracking
4. **📊 Measure Outcomes** - Focus on delivered working solutions
5. **🛠️ Adapt as Needed** - Switch frameworks if context changes mid-project

### Common Pitfalls

- ❌ **Framework Mixing** - Don't combine elements from different frameworks
- ❌ **Context Mismatch** - Using high-intensity frameworks for simple tasks
- ❌ **TODO Neglect** - Not maintaining the task tracking systems
- ❌ **Premature Optimization** - Ignoring the "ship first, optimize later" philosophy
